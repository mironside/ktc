<p>John Oaks is an emeritus faculty member of the School of Veterinary Medicine and has
been creating etchings for several decades. John’s etchings are made on copper plates and printed on his ~100
year-old etching press which is housed in the Crooked Line Etching Studio (CLES) at Winnebago Studios
Building, located in Madison, Wisconsin.</p>
<p>
John studied art at Pratt Institute and Colby College and worked with Larry Welo for about a dozen years before
buying his on printing press. Most recently he has been studying screen printing with artist and professor Jim
McKiernan at Madison College. John creates about three to five pieces a year in Crooked Line Etching Studio.
He shares CLES with his comrade and etcher, Burton Wagner. Most of his pieces are done with intaglio line
etching on copper plate. Some pieces combine line etching with chine collé, pastel, and/or stenciling with
colored engraving inks. More recently he has created several screen prints and, using methods developed by
UW artist Dean Meeker, he has combined etching with screen printing.</p>
